Name: Yunke Zhu
I spent 8 hours on this problem (1 on Prob. 1 and 3 on Prob. 2 and 1 on Prob. 3 and 3 on Prob. 4)
I asked help from TA Rita, Chen. 
The most difficult part for me is the discussion about the graph, mainly on problem 3 and 4. And they are most Tim consuming part as well. 
I also seated a lot data online from stack overflow and wikipedia and some blogs.
