I spent 4 hours on this problem (2 on Prob. 1 and 2 on Prob. 2)
I sought help from Google, Stack Overflow
I mainly spent time on the environment and priority queue in python. Some numpy library stuff took me some time as well.
I failed to use priority heap since it won't help me deal with equal situation..unless I define it with myself.
