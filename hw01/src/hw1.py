def split_into_train_and_test(x_all_LF, frac_test=0.5, random_state=None):
    ''' Divide provided array into train and test set along first dimension

    User can provide a random number generator object to ensure reproducibility.

    Args
    ----
    x_all_LF : 2D array, shape = (n_total_examples, n_features) (L, F)
        Each row is a feature vector
    frac_test : float, fraction between 0 and 1
        Indicates fraction of all L examples to allocate to the "test" set
    random_state : np.random.RandomState instance or integer or None
        If int, code will create RandomState instance with provided value as seed
        If None, defaults to the current numpy random number generator np.random

    Returns
    -------
    x_train_MF : 2D array, shape = (n_train_examples, n_features) (M, F)
        Each row is a feature vector
        Should be a separately allocated array, NOT a view of any input array

    x_test_NF : 2D array, shape = (n_test_examples, n_features) (N, F)
        Each row is a feature vector
        Should be a separately allocated array, NOT a view of any input array

    Post Condition
    --------------
    This function should be side-effect free. The provided input array x_all_LF
    should not change at all (not be shuffled, etc.)

    Examples
    --------
    '''
    np.random.seed(random_state)

    x_all_LF




    >>> x_LF = np.eye(10)
    >>> xcopy_LF = x_LF.copy() # preserve what input was before the call
    >>> train_MF, test_NF = split_into_train_and_test(
    ...     x_LF, frac_test=0.3, random_state=np.random.RandomState(0))
    >>> train_MF.shape
    (7, 10)
    >>> test_NF.shape
    (3, 10)
    >>> print(train_MF)
    [[0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
     [0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 0.]
     [0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
     [0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 1.]
     [0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
     [0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0.]
     [0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0.]]
    >>> print(test_NF)
    [[0. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
     [1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
     [0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.]]

    ## Verify that input array did not change due to function call
    >>> np.allclose(x_LF, xcopy_LF)
    True

def calc_k_nearest_neighbors(data_NF, query_QF, K=1):
    ''' Compute and return k-nearest neighbors under Euclidean distance

    Any ties in distance may be broken arbitrarily.

    Args
    ----
    data_NF : 2D array, shape = (n_examples, n_features) aka (N, F)
        Each row is a feature vector for one example in dataset
    query_QF : 2D array, shape = (n_queries, n_features) aka (Q, F)

    K : int, positive (must be >= 1)
        Number of neighbors to find per query vector

    Returns
