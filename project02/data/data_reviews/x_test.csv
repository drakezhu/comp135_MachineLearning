imdb,"Technically, the film is well made with impressive camera-work, solid acting and effective music from Riz Ortolani -- particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like it's coming from a distant hill.  "
yelp,!....THE OWNERS REALLY REALLY need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one!

amazon,Great Product.
amazon,I highly recommend this device to everyone!
yelp,Coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties can't wait for the other person to ask to break up.
imdb,I have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film!  
amazon,"Couldn't use the unit with sunglasses, not good in Texas!"
amazon,A good quality bargain.. I bought this after I bought a cheapy from Big Lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldn't hear me.
amazon,Nice design and quality.

amazon,Don't buy this product.
amazon,Poor sound quality.
amazon,I bought two of them and neither will charge.

yelp,definitely will come back here again.
imdb,This movie totally grates on my nerves.  
yelp,Will go back next trip out.
yelp,What a mistake.
imdb,The problem was the script.  
amazon,The volume for the ringer is REAL good (you have choices how loud).
imdb,"I agree with Jessica, this movie is pretty bad.  "
yelp,It shouldn't take 30 min for pancakes and eggs.
amazon,Perfect for the PS3.
yelp,But the service was beyond bad.
imdb,"Personally, I think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue.  "

yelp,Food quality has been horrible.
imdb,"It isn't even an achievement as a ""so-bad-it's-good"" or ""so-bad-it's-memorable"" movie.  "
imdb,"It's too bad that everyone else involved didn't share Crowe's level of dedication to quality, for if they did, we'd have a far better film on our hands than this sub-par mess.  "
imdb,Maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity.  
amazon,This company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back.

amazon,"What possesed me to get this junk, I have no idea..."
amazon,All it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was cracked.I am not impressed and I am not laughing.
