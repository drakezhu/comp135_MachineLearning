Name: Yunke Zhu
I spent 24 hours on this problem (18 hours on Part1 and 6 hours on Part2)
I sought help from Google, Stack Overflow
The library I used is sklearn.
And I searched some new data set from kraggle to test how my model works with more training dataset.
I also asked my friends' help and their suggestions.
